## This idea in short
In the publication 'Spectral Unmixing-Based Reaction Monitoring of Transformations between Nucleosides and Nucleobases' (doi: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202000204) it says:

> However, on average in approximately 1–2 % of all measurements, we observed increased absorption across the entire spectrum apparent as a distinct baseline shift (Figure 2C). This results in an inability to obtain accurate fits without manual spectral processing (which we choose to explicitly abstain from), as in these cases the baseline can be shifted >0.10 AU. The straightforward solution in this case is remeasurement of the sample in a different well, which generally resolves the problem. 

To check this hypothesis, it would be great to check with a microscope the well, and/or pipette the 'failing' solution into a different well and measure again, and/or ... Any further ideas? 

## Sounds great, but...
You are interested in this topic? But the idea is gibberish and incomplete, or non-sense? Well, you're probably right! 

All of this is work in progress -- I would be very happy if you get in touch so we can improve this!

## About this Farm of Ideas
[This "Farm of Ideas"](https://github.com/roberts-farm-of-ideas) is supposed to store ideas I would like to develop into scientific progress some day, and to store their progression from initial idea being had, over keeping them alive, to growing them into something real and then "harvesting". 

If you are faster in developing them, I am happy with you and for the world! :) Just to avoid me having spend time on something you already realized then, I would be grateful for a short letting-me-know email.
